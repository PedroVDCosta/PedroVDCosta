### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro, a 26 year old developer.

Iâ€™m a developer whoâ€™s passionate about solving problems and always eager to build something that has a positive impact in other people's lives.

I like to push myself and practice whenever possible, both at work/college and at home, and I'm looking for a space where I can grow, both as a person and as a professional.

In my current job as a full stack developer, I use Angular, HTML, CSS, JS and C#.

I like to push myself and practice whenever possible, both at work/college and at home, and I'm looking for a space where I can grow, both as a person and as a professional.

You can usually find me trying to learn new technologies, listening to music or practicing paddel.

Notice that this profile is under construction! Most of the projects I will have on here will be from coding courses I'm doing and from special occasions.
